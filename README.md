# Introduction
This marked my debut Power BI projectâ€”a challenge I eagerly embraced. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was in CSV format.
# Background
The primary goal was centered around delivering a comprehensive overview of the sales performance and profitability across various product categories, 
namely furniture, technology, and office supplies, within the timeframe from 2011 to 2014.
# Insights
1. Over the course of the four-year period, sales and profits were notably higher for technology products trailed by office supplies and then furniture. 
2. The highest sales and profits were documented in 2014, with subsequent years exhibiting a decreasing trend in performance, namely 2013, 2012, and 2011.
3. Upon deeper drill down, it was revealed that the bulk of product sales took place during the fourth quarter, notably in October, November, and December. This trend is likely attributed to heightened Christmas shopping activities during this period.
4. Across all categories of products, standard class emerged as the most favored shipping mode, while same-day delivery ranked as the least preferred option.
5. The Central region marked the highest sales figures, while Canada showed the lowest sales performance.
